                    The cat of the week is the cat that received the most likes
                    excluding dislikes from the previous week!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you upload a cat, voting for it starts from the next
                    week, ensuring that every cat has equal time for voting!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only registered user can upload cats, and they must
                    accept the terms and conditions before being able to
                    participate in the game!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a cat is uploaded, the information cannot be changed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The voting is reset every week, and a new round of voting
                    begins! All cats with their information and photos are deleted, 
                    except the cat, which wins Cat of the week!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now there is no prize for the winners, but in future we
                    are thinking to have!
